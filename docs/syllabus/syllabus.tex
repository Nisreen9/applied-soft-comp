\noindent\textbf{Objectives:}
This course introduces you to the emerging field of computational intelligence, a distinct approach to machine intelligence that diverges from traditional AI. The course encompasses artificial neural networks, evolutionary computing, and probabilistic reasoning.
The soft computing approach offers numerous potential applications to nearly any field. The purpose of this course is to introduce the basic concepts briefly, and then to move quickly on to application techniques. We will not assume prior knowledge of the theory, but we will move quickly, so those new to the subject matter will need to study extra hard. Though this is a difficult subject to teach as a 500-level course, and even more so as a 400-level one, I will make every effort to structure the course in a way appropriate to those levels. Each student will be required to develop one significant application as a project during the semester.


\vskip.15in
\noindent\textbf{Expected Student Learning Outcomes:}
After completing this course, students will:
be able to interpret and evaluate modern soft computing literature, concepts, methodologies, tools, and recent research topics; be able to implement and apply machine learning models, neural networks, and other soft computing techniques using appropriate mathematical/computational means; be able to design and conduct original research using soft computing methods and tools; be able to demonstrate integration of artificial intelligence concepts and practical implementation skills through development of a significant application project.

\vskip.15in
\noindent\textbf{Prerequisites:}
I try to manage the course in such a way to make it as open ended as possible.  By that I mean that on the one hand I try to make it possible for beginning graduate students and upper level undergraduates with no background in these areas to do well in the course if they apply themselves.  But on the other hand, I try to make it possible for already advanced students to expand their knowledge further.
In practical terms, students will ideally come to the class with the following knowledge:
1.	Basic competence in applied mathematics, which we will define here as calculus at least through partial derivatives and basic familiarity with concepts of optimization as well as discrete mathematics.
2.	Enough computer competence and programming skill to implement their projects on the computer in some form.

\vskip.15in
\noindent\textbf{Course structure:}
``Don't think! Feeeeeel'' is a famous quote by Bruce Lee in the movie \textit{Enter the Dragon}, and this is the guiding philosophy of this course.
The primary goal of this course is to \textbf{feel} the concepts and tools of network science through pen-and-paper exercises and hands-on coding.
The course will first cover the practical skills of network science, followed by their theoretical foundations.
The course activities include:
\begin{itemize}
\item The class will begin with a weekly quiz on Brightspace about the lecture topics in the previous week. This quiz is intended to review the lecture topics and to test your understanding of the concepts and tools of network science.
\item Biweekly coding assignemnt on Github Classroom. The assignments are intended for practicing and equipping you with the skills to analyze network data.
\item A short lecture to cover the theoretical aspects.
\end{itemize}

\vskip.15in
\noindent\textbf{Communications:}
We use Discord for quicker informal communications, Q\&A, team discussions, and other casual conversations. We will send you an invitation link through Brightspace. Feel free to NOT use your full name (e.g., “Jane D.”)
Announcements will be sent via Brightspace and Discord. Many course-related information will be shared on Discord. So, you will miss a lot of information if you are not on Discord.

\noindent\textbf{Course Policy:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Attendance}: If you are not able to attend the class in person, please request an excuse over email one day before the class. We may not accept excuses for reasons other than illness, accidents, job interviews, and conference travels. If you are not able to attend in person for more than two weeks due to illness or some other legitimate reason, please request an acceptable accommodation over email.
    \item \textbf{Laptop and mobile}: We want to engage in-class activities with you together. Please refrain from using laptops and mobile phones unless instructed.
    \item \textbf{Credit hours}: This course is a 3-credit course, which means that in addition to the scheduled lectures/discussions, students are expected to do at least 6.5 hours of course-related work each week during the semester. This includes things like: completing assigned readings, participating in lab sessions, studying for tests and examinations, preparing written assignments, completing internship or clinical placement requirements, and other tasks that must be completed to earn credit in the course.
    \item \textbf{Generative AI}: You may use artificial intelligence tools as learning aids for understanding course materials. However, the final submitted assignment must be original work produced by the individual student alone. If parts of the assignments are produced by generative AIs, you must indicate the generated parts and cite the source AIs. Refer to this format guideline: \url{https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai/}
    \item \textbf{Data backup}: You have the responsibility of backing up all your data and code. Always back up your code and data. You should at least use Google Drive or Dropbox at the minimum. You can also use cloud services like Google Colaboratory. Ideally, learn version control systems and use \url{https://github.com}. Loss of data, code, or papers (e.g. due to malfunction of your laptop) is not an acceptable excuse for delayed or missing submission.
    \item \textbf{Graduate Academic Consultants}: Binghamton University's Graduate Academic Consultants can help you with projects in this course. This is a free service. \url{https://www.binghamton.edu/grad-school/academic-support/graduate-academic-consultants/}

    \item \textbf{Bias-based incidents}: Any act of discrimination or harassment based on race, ethnicity, religious affiliation, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability can be reported at \url{https://www.binghamton.edu/diversity-equity-inclusion/reportbias.html} or to the Binghamton University Affirmative Action Officer at 607-777-4775.
    Sexual misconduct and Title IX
    \item \textbf{Sexual misconduct and Title IX}: Title IX and BU’s Sexual Harassment Policy regard any form of sexual harassment as a violation of the standards of conduct required of all persons associated with the institution. If you have experienced sexual misconduct or know someone who has, you can ask support from the University Counseling Center at 607-777-2772 (counseling, advocacy, and advice services). It is also important that you know that Title IX and University policy require me to share any information brought to my attention about potential sexual misconduct with the campus Deputy Title IX Coordinator or BU’s Title IX Coordinator. In that event, those individuals will work to ensure that appropriate measures are taken and resources are made available. Protecting student privacy is of utmost concern, and information will only be shared with those that need to know to ensure the University can respond and assist. Visit \url{https://www.binghamton.edu/counseling/resources/faculty/assault.html} and \url{https://www.binghamton.edu/services/title-ix/index.html} to learn more.
